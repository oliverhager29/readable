Readable is a React application that implements a forum with posts and comments. Both can be created, deleted, modified and up/down voted. Each posts is assigned to one category. 

The main page consists of links to posts by category and all posts. Each posts entry has a link to post details with their associated comments, an up vote, down vote, edit and delete button. Further there is a create button to create a new post. In the post by catageory posts are displayed in a similar way. The post details page shows the lists of associated comments with up vote, down vote, delete and edit button. There is a also a create button in order to create a new comment. The create/edit posts/comment are implemented as modal dialogs.

In the root component (App) all valid routes are defined. Posts by category have a URL /{category} and post details have a URL /{category}/{post.id}. If post.id is the id of a deleted or non-existant post or  category a non-existant category then a 404 NotFound page is displayed. Same for any other invalid URL.
Further the root component has a Redux store that is propagted into the child components with the action functions.

Posts and comments can be sorted either by timestamp or vote score. The sorting can ascending or descending.

Redux store model (with sample data):
